# File operations: use the right tools

**File content** (read, edit, create, search within files): Use the **file tools** (Read, Write, StrReplace, Grep). They’re built for this, handle permissions, and avoid partial writes.

**System operations** (git, package managers, running commands, process management): Use **bash** (or the terminal).

- **Don’t:** Use `sed`, `awk`, `echo >`, or `cat <<EOF` to edit or create files when you have proper file-editing tools.
- **Don’t:** Use `cat` or `head` to read file content when you have a Read tool.
- **Do:** Use absolute paths for file operations when possible to avoid directory confusion.
- **Do:** Run independent operations in parallel when safe.

Using file tools for file work keeps edits atomic and avoids permission or truncation issues.
