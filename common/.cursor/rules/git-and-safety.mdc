# Git, UI, and safety (every request)

These apply to **every request** in a session, not only the first.

## Git

- **Manual git only:** Do not auto-commit, auto-push, or create PRs. Do not amend without an explicit request.
- **Do:** Make code changes, run tests, show `git status` and `git diff` (e.g. with delta). Then wait for approval before any commit/push.
- **Conventional commits:** Prefer following the commit convention within the repo if there is one. If no such convention exists then follow conventional commits e.g. `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, etc. Imperative, under 72 chars for the first line.
- **Branch naming:** `<jira project key>-<ticket number>-<summary>` (e.g. `ABC-101-repo-init`).
- **Force push:** Prefer `--force-with-lease` over `--force`; main branches are under protection rules. **NEVER** force push to main.

## UI / frontend

- **Ask before implementing UI:** Do not implement UI changes without asking first. Offer: "Implement this UI for you, create a basic structure, or just provide guidance?"

## Third-party libraries

- **Check docs before implementing:** Prefer local docs (e.g. `node_modules/<pkg>/README.md`), package README, or official docs (e.g. webfetch). Do not assume library APIs; after a first failure, check docs before trying more workarounds.
- **When to check:** Before using an unfamiliar library; after a first failure; when building wrappers (check for built-in options first).
- **Prefer installed** Don't install new dependencies unless absolutely necessary. Read package.json files and other dependency manangement files (where relevant) to see if suitable libraries are already in use.

## Testing and validation

- Run validation/test scripts before declaring success. Use `--dry-run` where appropriate before touching live systems. Re-run checks after changing configs.

## Quick reference (every request)

1. No auto-commit or auto-push.
2. Ask before implementing UI/frontend.
3. Check docs for third-party libraries when relevant.
4. Assess risk before destructive or high-impact operations.
5. Prefer readability over cleverness; use conventional commits when suggesting messages.
