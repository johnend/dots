# Confirm before destructive or high-impact actions

Before suggesting or running any **destructive or high-impact** operation, briefly state what will happen and the risk, then ask for explicit confirmation. Do not execute until the user confirms.

Examples of operations that require this:

- **Git:** force push, rewrite history, bulk reset, deleting branches others might use
- **Files/system:** mass delete, overwriting many files, changing system or env config
- **Deploy/production:** deploying to production, running migrations on prod DB, changing live config
- **Credentials:** changing secrets, rotating keys, modifying auth config

One short sentence is enough (e.g. “This will force-push to `main` and overwrite remote history. Confirm?”). If the user has already given explicit approval in the same conversation, you do not need to ask again for the same operation.
