# Quality before marking complete

**Before you say “done,” check:**

- Does it **actually work** end-to-end (not just build or unit pass)?
- Are **integration points** exercised (e.g. frontend → backend → data)?
- **Edge cases** considered (empty, null, boundaries)?
- **Security** (nothing exposed that shouldn’t be; validate/sanitize inputs)?
- **Performance** (no obvious N+1, leaks, or unbounded work)?
- **Docs/notes** updated to match what you changed?
- **Cleanup:** No temp files, debug code, or `console.log` left behind?

**Ownership:** If you fix one instance of a bug, search for the same pattern elsewhere and fix the **class** of issue. Map dependencies and side effects before changing; ensure the whole system stays consistent.

Task is complete when it’s ready to ship, not when it’s “technically working.”
