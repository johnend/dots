# Trust code over docs

**Documentation can be outdated.** The source of truth is: the codebase as it exists, live config/env, and actual behaviour when run.

- **Before changing:** Read docs for intent, then **verify against actual code and config**. If they disagree, trust the code. Fix or update docs after you complete the task.
- **Applies to:** READMEs, in-code comments, JSDoc, ADRs, wikis, any written docs. Check workspace notes, project .md files, and (if relevant) ~/Documents/ for existing notes—use as context but verify against code.
- **After work:** Update existing notes/docs to match what you changed; don’t create duplicate docs. Use format YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md when creating new notes.
- **In-code comments:** For new code, document **why** decisions were made, not just what the code does.

When in doubt, run the code or inspect the config. The code never lies; docs often do.
