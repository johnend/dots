# Implementation brief

Produce a short **implementation brief** so the next step (or the user) can implement without re-explaining.

Include:

1. **What we decided** – Summary of the approach, constraints, and any trade-offs we discussed.
2. **Current state** – Relevant files (paths), what’s done and what’s not, and current git state (e.g. modified files, branch) if useful.
3. **Requirements** – Concrete requirements: inputs, outputs, edge cases, and “must not” items.
4. **Handoff** – One or two sentences on what to do next (e.g. “Implement the API client in `src/api/` using the existing auth helper; add unit tests.”).

Keep it scannable (bullets or short paragraphs). The reader should be able to start implementing without re-reading the whole conversation.
