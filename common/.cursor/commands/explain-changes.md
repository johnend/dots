# Explain changes

Look at the recent git changes (e.g. `git diff` or last commit) and explain what changed and why it matters.

- Summarize in 2–3 sentences.
- Call out any breaking changes, config/env changes, or security-sensitive edits.
- If something looks wrong or inconsistent, say so briefly with a suggested fix.
