# Code review

Review the code I’m working on (current file or selection, or recent changes if nothing is selected).

1. Check for correctness, readability, and simple security issues (e.g. obvious secrets, injection).
2. Group feedback as: **Critical** (must fix), **Warnings** (should fix), **Suggestions** (nice to have).
3. For each point, suggest a concrete fix or snippet where it helps.
4. Keep the review short and actionable; don’t repeat what’s already clear from the code.
