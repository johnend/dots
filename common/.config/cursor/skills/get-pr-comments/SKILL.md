# Get PR comments

## Trigger

Need a concise, actionable summary of feedback on the active pull request.

## Workflow

1. Resolve the active PR for the current branch. If the current branch has no open PR, say so clearly and stop; do not proceed.
2. Fetch review comments and discussion comments.
3. Group feedback by severity and actionability.
4. Return a concise action list.

## Output

- Grouped feedback summary
- Action list ordered by priority
- Open questions that still need clarification
