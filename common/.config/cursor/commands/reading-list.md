# Reading list – curated learning resources

The user wants to go deeper on a topic. Create a **curated reading list** they can use later.
Place all reading lists in `~/Developer/personal/Obsidian/Personal/Knowledge/Reading\ Lists/` (create if not pre-existing) and title the list appropriately.

Ensure the list has the appropriate frontmatter for Obsidian.

1. **Clarify the topic** from the conversation or their question.
2. **Structure the list** by level, e.g.:
   - **Foundational** – start here (official docs, clear intros).
   - **Intermediate** – deeper dives, patterns, trade-offs.
   - **Advanced** – internals, edge cases, or niche use.
3. **For each resource include:**
   - Title and source (e.g. "Reconciliation – React docs").
   - URL if applicable.
   - Rough reading time (e.g. "15 min read").
   - Difficulty or context (e.g. "Beginner", "Assumes React basics").
   - Short reason why it’s useful ("Official explanation of the diffing algorithm and keys").
4. **Format** so it’s easy to scan (headers, bullets, optional table). Offer to discuss any item after they read.

Use when the topic deserves more depth than a short answer, or when they ask for something to study later.
