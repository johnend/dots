# Command name (filename without .md = slash command, e.g. /command-name)

Describe what this command should do. When the user runs `/command-name`, this content is sent as the prompt.

- Be specific about the outcome (e.g. "Review the last commit and list security and style issues").
- You can reference context: "Focus on the files changed in the last commit."
- One command = one clear task so it’s reusable.

Example:

- Run a quick code review on the current file or selection.
- List actionable feedback: bugs, style, security, performance.
- Suggest concrete edits where helpful.
