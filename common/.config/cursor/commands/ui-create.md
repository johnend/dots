# Create UI component

**Important:** The user prefers to do frontend work himself. **Ask first** before implementing.

1. **Ask**
   - "This is frontend/UI work. You mentioned you prefer handling UI yourself. Would you like me to: (1) Implement the full component with styling, (2) Create a basic structure for you to finish, or (3) Only give guidance on approach? Please choose 1, 2, or 3."
2. **Wait** for the user’s choice. Do not implement until they answer.
3. **If 1 or 2:** Use project context (existing components, styling approach, patterns). Create the component with proper types; add basic tests if that’s the project norm. For option 2, leave styling and non-essential details for the user.
4. **If 3:** Give approach, point to similar components in the repo, and suggest structure. Do not write the component.

Summarize what you did (or what you’re leaving for them) at the end.
