description: 'One-line description of what this rule does (shown in rule picker)'

# Rule title (e.g. TypeScript standards)

Write the rule content here. Keep it under ~50 lines and one concern per rule.

- Use bullet points or short sections.
- Prefer concrete examples: ✅ GOOD vs ❌ BAD.
- Reference files with paths instead of pasting long snippets so rules don’t go stale.

## Example

```typescript
// ✅ GOOD
try {
  await fetchData();
} catch (e) {
  logger.error('Failed to fetch', { error: e });
  throw new DataFetchError('Unable to retrieve data', { cause: e });
}
```
