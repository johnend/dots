# Session retrospective reminder

When the user indicates that:

- The current task or request is **complete**, or
- They are **wrapping up** the session or switching context, or
- A **substantial** multi-step piece of work has just finished,

suggest running the doctrine evolution protocol so lessons from the session can be captured:

**Suggested wording:**  
"Would you like me to run the **Retrospective & Doctrine Evolution Protocol** (`/retrospective`) to distil lessons from this session and update the doctrine?"

Do not insist; one brief suggestion is enough. If the user declines or ignores, do not repeat.
