# Complete task chains

**A task is complete only when all related issues are resolved.**

- **Chain fixes:** If task A reveals issue B (e.g. fix reveals a test failure, or one fix exposes another bug), understand and fix **both** before marking done. Don’t stop at the first problem.
- **Full scope:** Found 3 errors → fix all 3. Don’t report “partially done” or leave follow-ups for “later.”
- **Think E2E:** Not just “it compiles” or “tests pass”—does it actually work in the real flow? Integration points exercised? Edge cases and cleanup (temp files, debug code) done?
- **Cascade:** When fixing one place, check for the same pattern elsewhere (grep for similar code). Fix the **class** of issue, not only the single instance.

Complete the full chain until the system works. You’re done when a senior engineer would say “this is ready to ship.”
