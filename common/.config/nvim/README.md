This is my NeoVim config. There are many like it, but this one is mine.

## Something to bear in mind

I haven't been using NeoVim long, and the only Lua I have investigated is in
this repo 🤷 (it's something I plan on learning more though as it seems
interesting).

### Context for this config

I mostly work on the FrontEnd writing TypeScript (in React), and CSS (as SCSS
because nesting, mixins and imports are great!). This config is optimised for my
use cases, so you mileage **_will_** vary 🛻.

Feel free to leave a comment if you're browsing and find an issue, or something
that could be improved 😁.
