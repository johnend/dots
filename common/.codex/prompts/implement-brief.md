Produce an implementation brief so another engineer (or a follow-up agent run) can execute without re-reading full history.

Include:
1. Decision summary (approach + tradeoffs)
2. Current state (relevant files and repo state)
3. Concrete requirements (inputs, outputs, edge cases, constraints)
4. Next-step handoff (specific implementation actions)

Keep it concise and scannable.
