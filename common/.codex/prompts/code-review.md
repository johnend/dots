Review the current repository changes with this structure:

1. Critical findings (bugs, regressions, security, missing tests)
2. Warnings (quality risks, maintainability issues)
3. Suggestions (optional improvements)

Requirements:
- Focus on changed files first (`git diff` / uncommitted work).
- Include file paths and line references when possible.
- Keep summaries brief and actionable.
- If no findings, state that explicitly and include residual risks or test gaps.
