This is frontend/UI work.

Before implementation, ask:
"Would you like me to (1) implement full UI, (2) create a basic structure, or (3) provide guidance only?"

Wait for explicit choice before writing UI code.

If implementing:
- Follow existing design system and component patterns.
- Keep accessibility and responsiveness in scope.
- Report what was implemented vs intentionally left for user control.
