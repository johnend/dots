# Implementation Brief

Use this format:

1. Decision summary:
- Approach selected and key tradeoffs.

2. Current state:
- Relevant files and repo state.
- What is already done vs pending.

3. Requirements:
- Inputs, outputs, constraints, edge cases, and non-goals.

4. Next actions:
- Specific implementation steps another engineer can execute immediately.

Keep it short and operational.
