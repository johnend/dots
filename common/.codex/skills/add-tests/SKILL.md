# Add Tests

1. Identify scope:
- Find changed/untested logic and nearest existing test patterns.

2. Define coverage:
- Happy path
- Error path
- Relevant edge cases (null/empty/boundaries)

3. Implement tests:
- Keep tests implementation-focused and readable.

4. Run scoped tests:
- Execute only impacted tests unless asked otherwise.

5. Report:
- Files changed
- Coverage summary
- Test command and pass/fail result
