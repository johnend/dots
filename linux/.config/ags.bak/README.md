# My Catppuccin Rice

I like Catppuccin, and I also like Hyprland.

This collection of bars and widgets and stuff is just my personal taste, and
hasn't really been implemented for consumption by other folks. However, if you
want to replicate any of this please feel free to take a look.

Things left to do:

1. Figure out how to manage custom icons and state within widgets

- Swapping custom icons for workspace indicators
- Swapping icons on click
- Updating icon colours when "active" (might need to be done with the state of
  child widgets most likely)

2. Figure out how to make the floating/revealing panels

- Launcher
- Settings
- Notifications

3. Ability to change to light mode? OR change colour palettes entirely?
4. Easier customisation of fonts?
