[Unit]
# More lenient restart behavior for handling transient USB disconnections
StartLimitIntervalSec=300
StartLimitBurst=10

[Service]
# More aggressive restart strategy
Restart=always
RestartSec=3

# Restart parameters to handle transient failures better
# Allow more restart attempts before giving up
StartLimitBurst=10

# Wait longer before trying to restart after a failure
# This gives the USB device time to stabilize
RestartSec=5

# More time for the service to start (useful if device is slow to appear)
TimeoutStartSec=30
