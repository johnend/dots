# My Sway stuff

This is where I keep some of the things I use on Sway, anything else that's common between my Linux machines is in the `../common` directory (`rofi` configs are in there).

Some things you might take inspiration from (with images in expandable sections for reference). The top bar is `waybar`.

## Ghostty, NeoVim, `spotify-player`, `fastfetch`, `btop` etc. etc.

Some of the config for these things can be found in the top level common directory (these are shared across my Linux machines, and my work Mac). Screenshot for some above.
