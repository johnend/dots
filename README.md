# Dotfiles

Hey there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my dotfiles! These are set up to fit my workflow across both Mac and Linux. Feel free to explore, steal bits, and make them your own.

### Linux (Sway)

I split configurations between macOS and Linux so everything works seamlessly on both machines. Below are some tools and notes to help you get started:

#### Tools Youâ€™ll Probably Want

- **GNU Stow**  
  A lifesaver for managing dotfiles. If you spend any time in the terminal, youâ€™ll appreciate how it keeps everything tidy. If youâ€™re not already using Stow, give it a try!

- **Zsh + Oh My Zsh**  
  Iâ€™m a big fan of Zsh and Oh My Zsh, and youâ€™ll find some of my favorite plugins and Powerlevel10k themes in here. If you want to grab my setup, thereâ€™s a script at `common/omz-install.sh` that installs everything for you. If youâ€™d rather pick and choose, treat it like a reference.

- **Sway (Linux)**  
  My Linux machine runs Sway. I switched from Hyprland because my old Mac struggled with it (thanks, Nvidia GPU ðŸ™„), but honestly, I prefer Sway for day-to-day use. If your rig can handle Hyprland, youâ€™ll find my old Hyprland configs in the `linux/` directory.

- **NeoVim**  
  All my NeoVim goodies live in `common/.config/nvim`. If youâ€™re looking for the ASCII art on my Alpha dashboard, thatâ€™s in there too.

#### How This Is Organized

Some app configs (like Alacritty and Kitty) are split between `common/` and the OS-specific folder, using imports in the OSâ€™s config file. This way, I can tweak things like font sizes (Hyprland scaling vs. macOS Retina) without duplicating everything.

Dive in, mix and match, and see what works for you!
