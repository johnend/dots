# Dotfiles

These dotfiles contain lot of stuff. Not all of it is complete.

NeoVim and other smaller tools are in a _more_ complete place than others (fzf,
tmux, bat some others).

## Some things to think about before you copy everything

- these dots are for me across MacOS, for work, as well as KDE and Hyprland,
- not everything is finished (AGS for example),
- some things could probably be better (many things)

### NOTE to self

- currently using `input-remapper` to have:
  - CAPS as a mod tap with HYPER as hold,
  - ESC as mod tap with MEH as hold,

Probably would be better to find something more useful for the tap on CAPS as
that's probably going to be annoying with accidental activations.

## TODO

- [ ] update AGS to include a bunch more functionality
  - [ ] run menu,
  - [ ] settings toggles (bluetooth, volume etc.)
  - [ ] wallpaper switcher
  - [ ] theme switcher (one day)
