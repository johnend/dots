# Dotfiles

NOTE: I am running Endeavour OS, and using KDE Plasma 6.
At some stage I will be moving to Hyperland but I need to buy a new machine first.
Currently running on a macbookpro11,3 (~10 years old).

I had previously been running Ubunutu on the latest stable, but for some reason I could never get the WiFi to work well.
Endeavour OS worked out the box for pretty much everything.

I'm currently working as a FE Software Engineer so my Neovim config is biased towards front-end right now. YMMV but currently it's working pretty well for my purposes.
